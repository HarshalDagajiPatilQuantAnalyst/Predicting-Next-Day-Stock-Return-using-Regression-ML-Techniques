# Predicting Next-Day Stock Return using Regression ML Techniques

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a practical use case encountered by Quantitative Analysts: using historical stock market data to predict next-day stock returns using regression machine learning techniques.

## Problem Statement
As a Quant Analyst, one common challenge is forecasting short-term returns for trading or portfolio allocation. This project focuses on creating a regression model to predict the next day's return of a selected stock using historical prices and technical indicators.

## Objectives
- Collect historical price and volume data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Engineer features from historical OHLCV data
- Train and evaluate regression models
- Interpret model results and metrics


## Machine Learning Models
- Linear Regression
- Ridge/Lasso Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- RÂ² Score

## Libraries Used
- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `xgboost`
